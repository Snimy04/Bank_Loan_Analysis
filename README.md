# Bank_Loan_Analysis
Our data analytics project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to loan transactions to derive insights that can inform strategic decision-making.  By leveraging data-driven techniques and statistical analysis, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. 


The project encompasses various key performance indicators (KPIs), including year-wise loan amount statistics, grade and sub-grade wise revolving balance, payment behavior based on verification status, state-wise and month-wise loan status, loan amount by purpose  and the relationship between home ownership and payment patterns.
 Through this analysis, we seek to provide actionable insights to optimize loan management, mitigate risks, and enhance overall performance.
